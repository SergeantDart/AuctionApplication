Our team  consisting of

has implemented a TCP server-client auction application using JAVA 1.8 Technologies.

Server is capable of processing multiple clients concurrently.

A client can be:

-- buyer, which can perform the following console commands :
    => list : lists all the currently auctioned items
    => bid <itemName> <moneyAmount> : makes a bid on a certain item on behalf of the logged in buyer
    => exit : finish the current session
    
-- seller, which can perform the following console commands :
	=> add <itemName> : adds a new item to the auction list
	=> list : lists all the currently auctioned items
	=> sell <itemName> : sells the mentioned item to the highest bider if available
	=> exit : finish the current session
	
P.S. : Server-client interactions are limited to the mandatory exchange of streams (get the input stream, and only then can respond back)
